/**
 * SetScores Left 4 Dead 2 plugin version 1.2. Allows players/admins to set the score for a match via the 
 * !setscores command in chat. Through the cvar setscore_allow_player_vote (default 1, enabled) server 
 * administrators may disable the vote functionality. The cvar setscore_force_admin_vote will force admins
 * to start a vote to change the score (default 0, vote not required). Additionally, the number of players 
 * required to initiate the vote may be configured by setscore_player_limit (default 2).
 *
 * Original Author: vintik
 * 
 * Contributors: purpletreefactory and Grego, added vote functionality and all chat messages
 *
 * Special Thanks: ProdigySim and Visor, code improvements and suggestions
 *
 * Testers: LuckyLock, DuckDuckGo, XBye, Statik
